Folder contents:
* [`protocol`](https://github.com/connect2brain/MoCsEFC/tree/main/protocol) contains the script `run_MoCsEFC.m` that was used to run the experiment. It uses `MEP_ioresponse.m` and the contents of `src`
* [`evaluation`](https://github.com/connect2brain/MoCsEFC/tree/main/evaluation) contains the evaluation code, in particular:
	* [`evaluation/review`](https://github.com/connect2brain/MoCsEFC/tree/main/evaluation/review) contains the scripts used for the final version of the manuscript AFTER review
* [`libraries`](https://github.com/connect2brain/MoCsEFC/tree/main/libraries) contains a README with the list of required Matlab libraries
* [`simulation-check`](https://github.com/connect2brain/MoCsEFC/tree/main/simulation-check) contains a simulation check of the impact of volume conduction on the connectivity of C3-Hjorth and C4-Hjorth (this requires the [New-York head model](https://www.parralab.org/nyhead/))
